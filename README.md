Start the development server with the following command:

pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`.

### 4\. Customize the template

There are a few things you need to change to customize the template:

  * **`!CHANGETHIS` comments:** Find all comments with `!CHANGETHIS` in the code and follow the instructions.
  * **`package.json`:** Change the package name to your project's name.
  * **Favicons and other assets:** Replace the default favicons and other assets with your own.

### 5\. Cleanup Script

This starter template includes several optional feature modules. If you don't need a specific feature, you can run the cleanup script to remove the associated files, dependencies, and provider configurations, keeping your project clean.

### Usage

To use the script, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
./cleanup.sh <component_name>
```
Available components:
You can replace <component_name> with one of the following options:
* `api`: Removes all files and dependencies related to API interaction and state management. This includes axios, @tanstack/react-query, zustand, react-hot-toast, and the authentication hooks/stores.
* `table`: Removes the Table component, which is built on @tanstack/react-table, and its related files and dependencies like nuqs.
* `form`: Removes the advanced form components and their dependencies, including react-hook-form, react-dropzone, react-select, and the lightbox modal.
* `button`: Removes the custom Button, IconButton, and related link components (ButtonLink, IconLink).
* `dialog`: Removes the custom ConfirmationDialog, and its dependencies.

Note: if the script is not executeable yet, you can run the following command
```bash
chmod +x cleanup.sh
```
